1) Suppose you have a file with the following permissions:

ls -l readme

-rwxrw---- 1 student clase 17 Jul 5 10:00 readme

Write the command line by using letters with chmod to set the following permissions:

rwxrwxr-x :

rwxr--r-- :

r--r----- :

rwxr-xr-x :

r-x--x--x :

-w-r----x :

-----xrwx :

2) Write the command line by using octal numbers with chmod to set the following permissions:

rwxrwxrwx :

--x--x--x :

r---w---x :

-w------- :

rw-r----- :

rwx--x--x :

3) With the following umask values what would be the files and directories creation permissions?

umask = 0027

File permissions:

Directory permissions:

umask = 0011

File permissions:

Directory permissions:

umask = 0541

File permissions:

Directory permissions:

umask = 0777

File permissions:

Directory permissions:

4) Create two user accounts

Logging in id: ada, group clase, with bash shell, home directory /home/ada

Logging in id: joe, group public, with bash shell, home directory /home/joe

For the two accounts set a password.

Logging in as ada and copy /bin/ls into ada home directory as myls. Change the owner of myls to ada and the permissions to 0710. What does this permission value mean?

Logging in as joe and try to use /home/ada/myls to list your current directory. Does it work ?

Create in /etc/group and /etc/gshadow a new group labo with ada and joe. Change the owner group of myls to labo.

Try again from joe account to execute /home/ada/myls to list your current directory. Does it work? Why?
