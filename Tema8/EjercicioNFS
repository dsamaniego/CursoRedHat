Exercise  - Configuring an NFS server
Reset your serverX.

1. On your VM, investigate what packages are related to nfs using yum list *nfs*. Can you
ascertain which package provides basic NFS functionality? (You may need to run yum info
on the packages)

2.Check that there are no updates pending for the package you found in 1. If so, update it.

3. Firewall: Only 172.25.X.0/24 network can access to nfs service.

4.Start the nfs service.

5. You must now create the data that you want to make accessible via NFS. Create a directory /usr/local/export
for your NFS-exported area. Create two subdirectories in /usr/local/export, one named 'root'
and one named 'all'. Place files in each directory. The permissions of 'all' and of all the files in it should be 777. 
The permissions of 'root' should be 700.
Both directories and all the files should be owned by root.

6. Create an /etc/exports file that exports /usr/local/export to the world unrestricted. 

7. export the filesystem

8. On desktopX system, create a directory /remote. Then mount your serverX exported filesystem
on this directory using the rw option.

9. As root, cd to /remote. Can you cd to each directory?
As student, cd to /remote. Can you cd to each directory?

10.  As root, cd to 'all' and try to create a file. Can you?
As student, cd to 'all' and try to create a file. Can you?

11. cd off of the directory and unmount it. Back on the serverX machine, change the mount options of your exported
filesystem to include rw. Then re-export your filesystem and retry the experiment (as root and student).

12. Again, cd off the directory and unmount it. Back on the serverX machine, add the mount option no_root_squash
to your filesystem and re-export it. After you remount the filesystem on the client, as root and student try to cd to the directory
'root' and create a file in it.

13. Fix your exports file so that /usr/local/export is exported read-only to all clients on your
subnet, with root_squash and sync options. Re-export your filesystems and configure NFS
to be available when your system starts.
