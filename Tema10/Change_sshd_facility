Choose an unused local facility. For example local3 is not used for any logging in your system. So first edit /etc/sshd_config configuration file.

 #SyslogFacility AUTH
 SyslogFacility local3

Now configure rsyslog to log local3 logs to a file that you need. Add the following to your /etc/rsyslog.conf .

#Logging sshd to another file. Using local3 facility.
local3.* /SOME/PATH/YOU/WANT/YOUR/SSHD/LOGS/TO-BE.log
